# MITRE

Registering Source Tokens to Target Language Spaces in Multilingual Neural Machine Translation

This is the repository for reproducing the data mining and pre-training described in our paper.

**Note**:  
Given that partial works done during Zhi Qu's internship at [ASTREC](https://astrec.nict.go.jp/) of NICT, Japan, some codes are under review of NICT.

The deatils of this repository would be provided soon. 

Please move to our HuggingFace pages, [MITRE_466M](https://huggingface.co/naist-nlp/mitre_466m) and [MITRE_913M](https://huggingface.co/naist-nlp/mitre_913m), which are another implementation of our codes and models and have the totally same performances. Currently, you can simply and directly employ our codes to generate.
