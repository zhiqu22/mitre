# MITRE

Registering Source Tokens to Target Language Spaces in Multilingual Neural Machine Translation

## Introduction
MITRE (Multilingual Translation with Registers) is a multilingual, decoder-only model designed for many-to-many translation tasks.  
The technology, i.e., registering, is introduced in our [paper](url_placeholder).  

This is the repository for reproducing the data mining and pre-training described in our paper.

**Note**:  
Given that partial works are done during Zhi Qu's internship at [ASTREC](https://astrec.nict.go.jp/) of NICT, Japan, the codes in this repository are under the open-source procedure of NICT.

Once the procedure is finished, we will release all codes immediately. 

However!!! You can move to our HuggingFace pages, [MITRE_466M](https://huggingface.co/naist-nlp/mitre_466m) and [MITRE_913M](https://huggingface.co/naist-nlp/mitre_913m), where we have already released another version of our codes and pre-trained models with the exactly same performance.
